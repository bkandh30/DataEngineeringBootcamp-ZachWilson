-- 1. Query to Deduplicate game_details
-- Explanation:
-- Using ROW_NUMBER() to remove duplicates based on (game_id, team_id, player_id).
-- LEFT JOIN ensures rows in `game_details` remain even if `games` might be missing data.

-- 2. DDL for user_devices_cumulated table
-- Explanation:
-- Table schema for storing device activity arrays. BIGINT is used here,
-- as it may be more suitable for user_id or device_id than NUMERIC.

-- 3. Cumulative query to generate device_activity_datelist from events
-- Explanation:
--   1) Collect today's rows from events (grouped by user/device/browser).
--   2) Collect yesterdayâ€™s snapshot from user_devices_cumulated.
--   3) Combine arrays via FULL OUTER JOIN, then insert new records.

--   2) Generate a day-by-day series for the month.
--   3) CROSS JOIN each device with each day to compute a bit-value if active.
